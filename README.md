# WarGames
A repository for the School project: RPG_Game using Object Oriented Programming concepts in C#.

## Project description

My project is more of a simulation war game, where you are the General of the United States Army.
It is heavily inspired by the movie "WarGames" from 1983, staring Matthew Broderick.
In this game you log in to this big Operating System, controlling the different fights, and
decisions, straight from the terminal of the "U.S.W.S - United States Weapons System".

The plan was to implement a currency system, where you could buy more army units and weapons
before each battle.
Besides that, you would get random occurances, influencing your unit size, money, and
population popularity.

It ended up being a short demo, where you instantly go to war with Russia, after logging
in to the U.S.W.S, using your last name.

One thing i would say had a great effect on the project, was the use of ASCII art,
illustraiting the battle, round by round. (Thanks to whoever created the different pieces)

There is also an easter egg, if your drop the nuke, the game ends because:

### There are NO winners in nuclear war!

* sidenote: 
This project we had to do in C#, which is not my cup of tea at all!

## Conclusion

This was a cool little assignment, where we had to make an Console "Rpg game", using
<i>Object Oriented Programming<I> concepts we learned the past 3 weeks.

I missmanaged my time (as always with these school projects), so there where a lot
of cool stuff i didn't have the time to implement.

I get to caught up in the "Design" of the applications and projects we have to do,
and therefore the code itself ends up a little rushed..

But all in all i think this project ended up being great, despite the missing concepts,
and or functionality.
